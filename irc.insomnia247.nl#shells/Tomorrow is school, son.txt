<dams> Spiders webs aren't venomous.
<dams> It's their butts that are.
<Cool_Fire> No it isn't
<dams> Also, from the looks of things... I see no 3rd party ya'll could have been talking too.
<Cool_Fire> It's their butts the produce web
<Cool_Fire> the have fangs
<dams> Hallucinating?
<Cool_Fire> Maybe a bit
<Cool_Fire> But my point remains valid
