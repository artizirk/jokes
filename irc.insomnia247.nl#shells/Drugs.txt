18:00 < mib_af36w1> hello
18:00 <~Cool_Fire> hi
18:00 < mib_af36w1> I have a question
18:01 < mib_af36w1> I haven't slept at all for 5 day's is this bad
18:01 <~Cool_Fire> You should probably go talk to a doctor
18:02 < mib_af36w1> no I can't I don't want anyone to know I told one friend she said I could die is that true
18:03 <+mikroskeem> you don't want anyone to know? Your friend and people who's online here now know you can't sleep
18:04 <+mikroskeem> so you better visit doctor
18:04 <+mikroskeem> anyway, no sleep -> tired all time -> can't do anything -> can't avoid accidents because of tiredness -> death
18:05 <+mikroskeem> mib_af36w1: ^^
18:05 < mib_af36w1> I don't want my family to know 
18:05 <@PowerWing> mib_af36w1: doctors have something called patient confidentiality
18:06 <@PowerWing> mib_af36w1: We're available for conversation and a listening ear but we're not used to dealing with people suffering from insomnia
18:07 < mib_af36w1> no I have energy my heart is racing my hands shake a little and I have hallucinations since Thursday
18:07 <+mikroskeem> mib_af36w1: drugs?
18:07  * retiredngrumpy dozes off into a nap
18:07 <@PowerWing> Sounds somewhat like sleep deprivation
18:08 <@PowerWing> problem is however that the human body isn't made to cope with that.
18:08 < mib_af36w1> can I get in trouble if I say yes?
18:08 <@PowerWing> mib_af36w1: not with us XD
18:08 <@PowerWing> We don't know who you are XD
18:08 < mib_af36w1> are you sure?
18:08 <@PowerWing> However depending on the drugs we reserve the right to call you an idiot.
18:09 <@PowerWing> mib_af36w1: I know that I myself won't do anything about you using drugs. mostly  because even if I wanted to I don't even know 
                   where you're from
18:09 <@PowerWing> I can call 911 but if you're in russia that's not going to do anything..
18:09 <@PowerWing> Also I doubt they'll listen to: "someone on the internet says he's doing drugs"
18:10 < mib_af36w1> ok I am a idiot I was using meth on Tuesday it's my 3rd time ever doing it
18:10 <@PowerWing> Well all I can say is that it certainly won't help you.
18:11 < mib_af36w1> then I didn't use on Wednesday I was feeling bad so my friend give me more 
18:11 <@PowerWing> And certain bodily functions may give out due to either sleep deprivation or meth.

18:11 <@PowerWing> Also sounds like withdrawal symptoms..
18:12 <@PowerWing> When meth leaves the body it will always feel weaker/crappy etc.
18:12 <@PowerWing> And putting more meth in won't help.
18:12 <@PowerWing> Just grows an addiction that will ruin your body.
18:13 <@PowerWing> Also the shaking of hands is a classic withdrawal symptom. 
18:13 < mib_af36w1> I don't feel crappy tho I know I should have by now
18:13 <@PowerWing> mib_af36w1: In that case be glad. But just do me a favor and don't do any more meth no matter what happens
18:13 <@PowerWing> Because it won't help you
18:14 < mib_af36w1> how much longer do you think I will be awake? 
18:14 <@PowerWing> I don't know. Like I said we're not a doctor Also I doubt the doctor will be able to put a time to anything
18:14 <@PowerWing> I can only suggest you find a calm spot and get some rest
18:15 < mib_af36w1> last night I was out almost the whole night trying to get more 
18:15 <~Cool_Fire> It really depends on the dosage you took, how often/long etc. But yeah, it could be a little while before you can sleep normally. 
                   And even longer for all the side effects to wear off completely
18:15 <@PowerWing> If the problems persist call a doctor because nothing you've described is "good". THey're not all bad. Doing meth once or twice 
                   won't kill you (if it stays with that). But everything combined sounds like a catastrophe waiting to happen
18:16 <@PowerWing> Also I gotta run, but hang in there
18:17 <~Cool_Fire> I'd take his advice about trying to rest though
18:18 < mib_af36w1> I am laying in my bed now I can't stop thinking about getting more. my friend won't give me more so I was trying to get from some 
                    other guy
18:18 <~Cool_Fire> Find some place quiet and comfortable and get some rest at least. Even if you can't sleep, rest is still helpful

18:20 <~Cool_Fire> But be prepared, it could be as much as 90 days after the last hit before you're completely back to normal.
18:21 < mib_af36w1> my chest feels kinda funny and my face is like half numb but it's not
18:22 <~Cool_Fire> That'll happen yea
18:23 < mib_af36w1> 90 days wow. when I did it second time I swear to myself never do it again
18:23 <~Cool_Fire> It's a hard thing to control
18:25 <~Cool_Fire> Short of having someone punch you in the face every time you consider it, self-control is the only way
18:25 < mib_af36w1> I was good then Monday I have a dream I was smoking it the whole time so when I wake up first thing I do is call some guy to buy it
18:27 < mib_af36w1> well if I have no money I wouldn't buy it. now I am trying to not spend 300 on meth
18:29 <~Cool_Fire> It's easy to let that slide on
18:32 < mib_af36w1> ehh stupid meth. but why am I not withdrawing yet? last time I take it around 3 
18:33 < mib_af36w1> yesterday
18:35 < mib_af36w1> cool fire
18:35 <~Cool_Fire> I'll happen sooner or later
18:35 <~Cool_Fire> Exactly when depends on the quality, dosage and what you've done in the mean time

18:39 < mib_af36w1> so It's not life threatening? not sleeping for 5 or 6 day's straight cause I don't want to go to the er then everyone will know
18:40 <~Cool_Fire> Sleep deprivation in itself is not life threatening, the secondary effects can be though
18:40 < mib_af36w1> what effect? 
18:41 <~Cool_Fire> Confusion, disorientation, visual hallucinations
18:41 <+Keanu73> Hi everybody
18:41 <+Keanu73> :P
18:42 <~Cool_Fire> Those are the sort of things that will easily put you in a car crash for example
18:43 < mib_af36w1> oh I was driving yesterday my little sister and her friend but I was in full control 
18:44 <~Cool_Fire> That in itself is a good example of losing the ability to properly reason about making decisions.
18:44 <~Cool_Fire> You'd know you shouldn't be driving in that condition. Even more so if you're driving your little sister
18:45 <~Cool_Fire> Because being in control isn't the same as being able to react to danger normally

18:47 < mib_af36w1> I know I wasn't going to but they beg me I finally gave in. I was worried about hallucinations cause they started day before 
                    yesterday. 
18:55 < mib_af36w1> ok thanks for talking to me. sorry about the way I type I don't talk like that it's just very difficult to focus on my phone 
                    screen I have to look away every few word. I will never do this
18:56 < mib_af36w1> drug again.
