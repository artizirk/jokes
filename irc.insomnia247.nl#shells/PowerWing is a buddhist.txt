15:31 <+mikroskeem> Keanu73: if you don't stop doing drugs you will die about at 40 yrs
15:31 < wei2912> looks like plan A isn't working
15:31 < wei2912> okay, troll mode on then
15:31 < dams> OOhhh.. the male partner is taking concern about his mate
15:31 < wei2912> cucumbers cucumbers cucumbers
15:31 < wei2912> THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
15:31 < dams> THis is way... better than national geography
15:31 < wei2912> ofc
15:32 < wei2912> national geography involves taking a stone from a volcano and sticking it up in your ass, dams
15:32 <+mikroskeem> lol
15:32 < wei2912> and ofc it must be local
15:32 < wei2912> otherwise it's not national
15:32 < wei2912> mikroskeem, also, your knives are useless
15:32  * dams has a hot ass
15:32 < dams> CHicks dig it.
15:32 <@PowerWing> Keanu73: nice that you're "never" dead but never implies a sense of repeatability.
15:32 <+mikroskeem> dams: more like gays dig it
15:33 <@PowerWing> And you can only die once.
15:33 < wei2912> how do YOU know
15:33 <@PowerWing> You can fail at dying multiple time but really die is exclusive :D
15:33 <+mikroskeem> PowerWing has died twice
15:33 < dams> He's a buddhist
15:33 < wei2912> if i can live and die at the same time
15:33 <@PowerWing> I failed to die quite a few times
15:33 <+mikroskeem> he lost his hands and eyes
15:33 <+mikroskeem> he writes with sense of smell
15:33 < dams> and his penis
15:33 < wei2912> then i am living and dying repeatedly
15:33 < wei2912> and hence i've died multiple times
15:33 <@PowerWing> Last week I was on a train and it didn't derail, crash, and burn...
15:34 <@PowerWing> Hence I failed at dying.
15:34 < dams> PowerWing: The train regrets that.
15:34 < dams> to carry you every week
