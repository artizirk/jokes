13:36 <~Cool_Fire> Hey
13:38 <+Keanu73> Cool_Fire: btw I discovered something
13:38 <+Keanu73> when you cd into /home, it displays all the user's shells
13:38 <+Keanu73> including mine and yours
13:39 <+Keanu73> but when you cd into someone's user directory, it replies with permission denied lol
13:44 <+mikroskeem> Keanu73: seems legit
