14:49 <+dams> mikroskeem: Jelos?
14:49 <+mikroskeem> with firefox or opera, google chrome blocks some ports

14:49 <+mikroskeem> dams: yes because you live longer :D
14:49 <+mikroskeem> if you're 3 yr...
14:50 <+dams> I forgot. My firewall's blocking those ports.
14:50 <+mikroskeem> lol
14:50 <+dams> too lazy to shut it off.

14:51 <+mikroskeem> or you actually don't have mother?

14:51 <+dams> Why do people keep saying that?!
14:52 <+mikroskeem> lol
14:52 <+mikroskeem> bit sad...
14:52 <+dams> I've got "you're adopted", 'you're genetically created', 'god
              created you' (and this argument eneded by going to an "almost"
              priest)
14:52 <+dams> I'm an alien bishes.
14:53 <+mikroskeem> makes sense
14:53 <+dams> How so?
14:53 <+dams> It's as if you knew that we didn't have mommas
14:53 <+dams> but were created through a special manufacturing process, that
              gave us a distint, highly graded bu predictable, identity
14:53 <+mikroskeem> it makes sense by that way you talk like alien
14:53 <+dams> Or that.
14:54 <+mikroskeem> yes
14:54 <+dams> THat's like calleng blacks negros..
14:54 <+dams> or chinese.
14:54 <+dams> chinese.
14:55 <+mikroskeem> aliens kidnapped me and they did put some machines to my
                    butt
14:55 <+dams> erm.. you're mistaking your butt with your food pipe, again.
14:55 <+dams> You should stop defaecating from the food pipe often. This is
              what happens, then. :P
